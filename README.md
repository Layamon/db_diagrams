# InnoDB Diagrams #
> The purpose of this project is to build complete and understandable InnoDB internals diagrams. This project is a work in progress and should not be considered complete. These diagrams are based on intensive study of the InnoDB code in addition to re-implementation of the data structures therein in Ruby in the [innodb_ruby](http://github.com/jeremycole/innodb_ruby/) project.

> This work has primarily been completed by:
> * Jeremy Cole ([jeremycole](http://github.com/jeremycole/))
> * Davi Arnaut ([darnaut](http://github.com/darnaut/))

eems that the original diagrams from xxx/xxx are based on MySQL 5.6. Updates in MySQL 5.7(8.0) are not covered. Recently I've been working on the later version, and I'm willing to add some informative diagrams. Besides MySQL (Innodb), this repo will also present diagrams for other system fundamentals, like PostgreSQL, Network and OS.
