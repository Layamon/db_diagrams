# InnoDB Diagrams #
> The purpose of this project is to build complete and understandable InnoDB internals diagrams. This project is a work in progress and should not be considered complete. These diagrams are based on intensive study of the InnoDB code in addition to re-implementation of the data structures therein in Ruby in the [innodb_ruby](http://github.com/jeremycole/innodb_ruby/) project.

It seems that the origin diagrams is based on 5.6, and has some error with 5.7(8.0);
I will update some new diagrams with 5.7 or 8.0 when I have read some part of the code.

except mysql/innodb, this repo will append some other system, such as postgresql/network/os and so on
